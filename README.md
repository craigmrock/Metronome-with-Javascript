Metronome with Javascript 

Context: I wanted to learn how to code a metronome, as they are great tools for practicing musical instruments.
Action: I did some research and found lots of good information and tutorials on how javascript could accomplish the task and address the problems with ensuring the timer is accurate. 
Result: It's a fun, useful learning tool that adds new excitement to learning to play any instrument!
Reflection: I want to keep learning other ways to do this project and how to bring coding and music education together.
